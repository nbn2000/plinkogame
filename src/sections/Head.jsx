            Plinko has gained popularity since its debut on the TV show ‚ÄúThe
            Price is Right.‚Äù The concept is simple: a board filled with pegs, at
            the top of which balls or chips are dropped, and winnings are
            awarded based on where the ball lands. This game is straightforward
            yet exciting, as the unpredictable bounces of the ball make for a
            thrilling experience every time.
